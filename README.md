# hello-world
My name is Patrieca and I'm learning to code. I've always been interested in what goes on behind a webpage, but I didn't think I was smart enough to learn it. I finally decided I was going to try and now I'm working on a portfolio after taking courses in R and SQL. I'm on a journey to become a data analyst and I'm taking my time getting there. 
*The journey is the destination.*
